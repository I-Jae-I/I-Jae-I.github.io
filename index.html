 				</div>
 				<p>Greetings! My Name is Hans Mendoza and I'm somewhat of a tech person that indulges in anything tech related be it computer, home automation
 					and overall thinkering. I was born and raised in the Philippines where I spent the first 9 years of my life before migrating to Australia 
 					with my entire family due to my father's work. A small town in NSW is where we inhabited first where I spent my schooling years from year
 					4 to 6, then moved to Adelaide after my father found another workplace.

 						<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
 						<p>	
 							My interest and journey in IT began when I received an Xbox 360 for my birthday after I moved to Australia. This started my indulgent into IT when I discovered that most of the games I enjoyed and loved can be further improved through the modifications and alteration of the game’s files, being Mods. Such discovery blessed me with dozens of hours of new content at a price of none, though I also unravelled that I can also use this to ‘cheat’ in essentially most games by giving my player money, items, god-mode and a plethora more.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							The interest in technology expanded even further after stumbling across the popular tech channel, Linus Tech Tips (LTT) and the goofy Michael Reeves. The vast hardware and the pc builds that LTT where reviewing and completing which pushed me into building my own and discover the infinitely massive task/things that can be accomplished with it from home automation to servers. Michael Reeves displayed that coding can be utilized and implemented into hilarious and unorthodox ways, be it building a scream powered microwave or a chair that electrocutes you when you do not find waldo.

 						<h1>Why RMIT?</h1>
 						<p>	
 							RMIT was mainly chosen due to the amazing flexibility that it offers compared to that of other institutions, also the reputation and stories I have heard from people and friends made it far more appealing. Full-time online studies and other factors made RMIT the logical choice to study in as in campus study was rather challenging requiring lengthy commutes and having to forcefully wake up early.

 						<h1>End of degree</h1>
 						<p>	
 							After finishing the Information Technology course, the outcome is to have a broad general understanding of what the degree can be utilized for personal use and career advancement. A career I would love to pursue would be to work for an organisation that would allow myself to work with various people on fun and exciting projects, or become somewhat of an individual that creates things like Michael Reeves and teach people about how it works and how to make it.

 							I personally see this position interesting as this allows the employee the opportunity to learn thoroughly about several companies in the industry in a short period and utilize both their technical skills and knowledge as well as accounting/business skills. The ability to identify and recommend ways to reduce risk, improve efficiency, etc. to a company excites me as I know that in a way, I can make a positive impact on a company.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							This job allows the employee to gain different opportunities which allows them to constantly learn new skills and knowledge. The relationships you’re able to make due to the engagement you make to the organisation staff and different companies is amazing as you’re able to surround yourself in a positive workplace and expand your network.
 						</p>
 						<p>
 							The skills I currently possess are years from reaching the requirements though to achieve the skills will require extensive knowledge in IT, audit experience and management skills.  These skills can be gained through experience, courses, and self-learning and by achieving such skills, certification and the ability to implement the gained skills to develop and progress my career.

 					<div class="q1">

					</div>

 					<p> 
 						After completing the personality test from 16personalities.com, ISTP-A / ISTP-T is the personality type that I was given and upon further reading and thinking this is relatively suits me. This personality indicates that the person prefers physical/hands-on learning compared to other types and enjoys exploring ideas through creating troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. ISTP-A / ISTP-T also appreciate other people take interest in their own projects which completely describes the type of person that I am as I’m constantly teaching my close-friends about the things that I’m passionate and interested about being technology.

 					<h6>What does this mean?</h6>
 					<h1>Dare to Differ</h1>
 					<p> 
 						As friendly and fantastic as ISTP-A / ISTP-T they are very private, spontaneous and extremely but unable to stay focused on formal studies and they are a challenge to predict. This indicates that staying focused and motivated o formal studies and work would prove challenging and require discipline to complete. This reason would greatly impact the type of position/role for an organisation as losing interest in projects would be problematic as an employee.

 					<h1>Team Influence</h1>
 					<p> 
 						Being a physical learner and rather loosing interest in anything formal like report writing brings a considerate number of pros and cons. Pros being that anything physical related such as coding, designing and tinkering will be attempted and completed with relative ease and will certainly ask for help and/or advice from fellow team members, resulting in rapid relationship building. Con being that anything that involves the tedious work like report writing will most likely lose my interest though it can be completed but will require a lengthy time to do so.

 					<p> 
 						Forming the ideal team will require people with equal and opposite learning style, since a team consisting of people that neutralizes the weakness of the others as this can maximise efficiency and quality of work produced. However, people from the same learning style will not consist of the same skills and learning ability and will have to understand and comply in order to maintain a positive relationship between teammates. Such a diverse team will allow each teammate to perform and display their full set of skills and learn new ones.

 				<div class="personality-img">

 				<div class="personality-stuff">
 					<h6>Overview</h6>
 					<p> 
 						The project is to create a powerful IOS app that is able pull data from certain websites, mostly one that host e-books, light novels, manga, comics and a plethora more. Main motivation to create such app is due to the absence of such app that can do the required functions and features present in the app store now, though there are some apps that are able to do some of the features, however they all contain flaws in certain ways. 
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						This app is mostly intended for IOS devices as a less powerful app currently exist for Android devices and the IOS apps that offer all listed services all have their own individual apps, requiring a combination of multiple apps whereas this will both eliminate the plethora of apps needed and the chunkiness that they present having to switch between multiple apps.
 					</p>
 				</div>	
 			<div class="w2">
 				<div class="personality-img">

 				<div class="personality-stuff">
 					<h6>Description</h6>
 					<p> 
 						This project app allows you to read any type of content from your IOS device with ease be it manga, light novels, e-books etc. from any source you know and prefer thus possessing a rather extensive range of catalogue and languages you speak/prefer (titles might be limited in other languages due to lack of translation). 
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						Pre-existing sources from known sites will be available to choose from though if a title/series is missing or unavailable from the existing ones, a feature enables the user to add the source that the series/title is from allowing the user the flexibility and freedom to the desired content with little hassle.
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						Some of the features of the app are the ability to change the preferred page sizing/reading, type of page scrolling like infinite page scrolling, classic book animation page turning and regular left or right page turning. Other features include the ability to change the theme of the app from light to dark with intentions to allow the user to create and incorporate their own custom themes, and a community theme page that allows users to share their created themes; change font sizes and styles from a library or user custom styles; change the layout of the app by hiding some tabs or shifting how their content is displayed on the app; Custom update notifications that allows the user to decide how frequent the app scans for updated content; Custom content notification within the app which indicated how many new chapters or articles have been added to the title/series; and plethora more features. 
 					</p>

 				<div class="personality-stuff">
 					<h6>Tools and Technologies and Skills Required</h6>
 					<p> 
 						Since the application is targeted towards IOS devices the main program and language used to create the application will be XCode as the program and Swift as the language, also learning to use the Mac interface and the Swift coding language is required to begin as this language is different to other languages used to create applications for mobile devices. 
 					</p>
 					<p>
 						An Apple computer and device will be required to create the app and test it, as currently XCode is an apple proprietary program which is the only program to my knowledge which allows the creation of apple apps as the code is different to that of android apps and the language used to create android apps. This requires the me to either have an Apple computer to create the app or purchase one, however there are ways that allows a programmer to use a windows machine to create and code IOS apps without an Apple computer, though this is ill advised from Apple.
 					</p>

 				<div class="personality-stuff">
 					<h6>Outcome</h6>
 					<p> 
 						With the IOS app development successful then the need of multiple apps and the lack of content from existing sites will no longer be needed, as this app alone is powerful enough to replace existing apps from the same category from the app store and contains enough features and flexibility to do so. This also allows the user to fully customise the app to their preferred choice allowing a far emissive and enjoyable experience to the end user.
